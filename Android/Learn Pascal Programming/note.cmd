One last note on errors: there are 2 main types of errors, namely - Runtime Errors and Compilation Errors.

Runtime errors are those which occur unexpectedly during the execution of the program,
whereas a Compilation error is one which is detected during the compilation process.
Note that a decimal number is also considered as a wrong input;
a decimal number must not be input, since it is a real number (more on this later).
